## Bienvenidos!
Hello peoples. This is the repo for our Java The Hutt robot. 
It has the updated code that will use a ground intake and adjustable shooter for the 2024 FRC game.
It adds [PathPlanner](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner) for autonomous code to allow mapping trajectories.

The project is built off of the SwerveWithPathPlanner project from [CTRE](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix6-Examples)

The offical name of the robot is Java the Hutt. Anyone who calls it Frodo is wrong and will be charged with treason.
